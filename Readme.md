Redux effects driver for localStorage

## Installation

    $ npm install redux-effects-localstorage

## Usage

Simple [redux-effects](https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects) driver for [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).  Add it to your redux middleware stack like this:

```javascript
import localStorage from 'redux-effects-localstorage'

applyMiddleware(localStorage(window.localStorage))(store)
```

And then dispatch it actions, like this:

```javascript
store.dispatch({
  type: 'EFFECT_LOCALSTORAGE',
  payload: {
    type: 'set',
    key: 'todos.0',
    value: 'Clean the kitchen'
  }
})
```

Or, use the action creators that come bundled with it:

```javascript
import localStorage from 'redux-effects-localStorage'

store.dispatch(localStorage.setItem('todos.0', 'Clean the kitchen'))
```

The API of the action creators is identical to that of the native localStorage object, with the sole exception that the property `length` has been changed to the function `getLength`.

## Use with sessionStorage

Each of the action creators takes another parameter, `STORAGE_TYPE`. You can access this from `STORAGE_TYPE` exported by this module. Values are `local` (the default) and `session`, which you can use if you want the actions to be applied to session storage rather than local storage.
